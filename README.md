# Coffee_Sales_Analysis
I have analysed vendor's cofee sales to solve his business problems and explore his sales 
#1-Received Raw data from Vendor
#2-Data cleaning
#3-Checked the blanks and other client data was not present hence replaced by business understanding words
#4-Xlookup and Vlookup used to get further parameters for insightful data calculations
#5-There was a scope to use Index-match alternatively
#6-Pivot and Visualization used for final presentation
